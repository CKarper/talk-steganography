    * What is this talk?
        * This is a talk about secret codes, and recapturing the fun we had as kids passing notes, writing coded messages, or using invisible ink.

1. Background on Steganography
    * What is the word?
      * Greek roots
        * Steganos - Concealed, Protected
        * Graphein - Writing
    * What is the difference between cryptography and steganography
        * Cryptography is obviously encoded content, that can't be understood without the proper decryption key.
        * Steganography is hidden content, that <main></main>ay be trivially understood once found.
        * Both systems can be applied to create hidden, encrypted messages.
